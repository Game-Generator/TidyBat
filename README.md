Tidy Up your Windows PC with batch files

##Description
TidyBat offers a few Standalone batch fiels which will help to maintain your computer and delete probably unnecessary data.
Be always aware that these are destructive actions.

###Clean functions
Currently there are available batch files to clean:

####DNS Cache:
Cache for already resolved IPs. Makes the acces to the source faster, because no more resolving necessary, but can hold old data and might be a security risk for malicouse modifications.

####Temp folder:
Many programs save temporary data in the Temp folder. This e.g. can be one setup necessary for an update or a file to temporary save intermediate results at runtime. 
Best time for clearing is before a restart or shutdown of the PC if you have not installed a new app or update which require a restart.

####RecycleBin:
Normal deleted files or folders land here. Shows the delete actions done to have the possibility to bring the data back.
